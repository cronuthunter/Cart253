Holiday Card Simulator is a light hearted concept that hits close to home. The premise of the simulator is to have a holiday card with your friends and family even if you cannot be physically together, this final is a response to closed boarders and travel restrictions throughout covid. Although the boarder rules are slowly easing, we collectively spent 2 years apart from family and friends who do not live in our country, and at times our province. At the beginning of covid my grandfather suffered a stroke and spent some time in the hospital. As the winter rolled around and covid restrictions got tighter it became clearer and clearer I would not be able to see my grandfather again. The last time a spoke to him was on the phone on Christmas morning, a month later he sadly passed. I did not get to see my grandmother until this November when the funeral was held. Covid brought pain and suffering to everyone and many people experienced loved ones passing whether it was from the virus or not. My hopes with this simulation is to bring light hearted fun to such a dark time for many while bringing us closer to our friends and family.
