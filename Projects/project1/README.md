This program is a Zen Art Studio program. The pandemic raised 2 pain points relating to the subject. A) I really miss art studios, (I haven't been in 1 in almost 3 years!!!) and B) inspiration is hard to find, especially during the pandemic. Zen Art Studio should be used as a warm up before art making to get your mind primed and present for making meaningful mark making.
